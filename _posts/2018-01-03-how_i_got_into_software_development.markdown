So this story begins back in high school in the computer lab; back then, the internet had just started taking off, we still had 56k modem connections, there were no smartphones and I had no idea how the innards of a computer worked… but I liked videogames and understood that to make a videogame you had to manipulate computers to write code in way that when you input commands in the controller the character in the screen would move. That seemed like magic to me at the time so I began to get curious about how it actually worked. However, when it was time to make a choice for a university program computers didn’t seem like my calling. 

That was until one night when my father started asking questions about my career choices. So in the end, and for a brief period of time, I gave a shot to Electronic Engineering.

I must admit not everything was O.K. at the time. My grades were not that great and I could manage some classes but others would feel out of place for me. 

In my second semester I had a class that would define a lot of things later in my life. Programming fundamentals was a bit weird to me. Everything was quite abstract and I was more focused in the hardware side of things in a computer, but after a few lessons in how computers follow commands and how it would shape the future of communication I started to fall in love with these concepts. It was a that time when I saw a few lines that are so simple yet they embrace what thousands of people do for a living and define careers and lives, these lines where written in java for me and although each software developer begins their own way it always looks similar to this:

 ```
 ``public class HelloWorld {
 
 ``public static void main(String[] args) {
 
         ``System.out.println("Hello World!");
    `` }
 	 ``}
 ```

The phrase “Hello World!” was shown in the console of the computer after compiling. It was my first program and the first step into doing something I love.

As I said before, I was briefly in an Electronic Engineering program in the university; luckily that summer me and my family moved to the U.S.A. and I had a clean slate since I had to revalidate coursework anyway, but this time I knew what to choose.

So there it is, I guess some developers actually realize sooner what they want to do, others look for it after choosing something entirely different. Some others, like me, completely stumble upon it.
